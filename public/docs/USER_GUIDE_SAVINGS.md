## 📈 Understanding Savings Analytics

- **Total Target**: Sum of all goal targets
- **Total Saved**: Current savings across all goals
- **Completion Rate**: Overall progress percentage

### Individual Goal Metrics

- **Monthly Target**: How much to save per month to reach goal
- **On Track**: Whether you're meeting monthly targets

## 🎯 Setting Realistic Goals

### Tips for Goal Setting:
1. **Be Specific**: "Vacation Fund $5000" is better than "Save money"
2. **Set Realistic Targets**: Based on your income and expenses
3. **Set Dates**: Deadlines create urgency and motivation
4. **Start Small**: Break large goals into smaller milestones
5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust goals as your situation changes

### Calculating Monthly Savings:
If you have a target amount and target date:
- Total amount needed ÷ months remaining = monthly savings target

**Example:**
- Goal: $12,000 by December (6 months away)
- Monthly target: $12,000 ÷ 6 = $2,000/month

## 💡 Best Practices

### Managing Multiple Goals
1. **Prioritize**: Focus on high-priority goals first
2. **Balance**: Don't spread yourself too thin across too many goals
3. **Review**: Regularly review and adjust all goals
4. **Celebrate**: Acknowledge progress on each goal

### Staying Motivated
1. **Visual Progress**: Check progress bars regularly
2. **Set Milestones**: Break large goals into smaller milestones
3. **Track Consistently**: Regular updates maintain momentum
4. **Share Goals**: Telling others can increase accountability

### Regular Updates
1. **Weekly Check**: Review all goals weekly
2. **Monthly Review**: Update amounts monthly
3. **Quarterly Assessment**: Evaluate if goals still make sense
4. **Annual Planning**: Plan new goals for the year
