# 📊 Balance Sheet Guide

Understand your financial position with a comprehensive balance sheet showing assets, liabilities, and equity.

## 📚 What is a Balance Sheet?

A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows:
- **Assets**: What you own (cash, bank accounts, investments, etc.)
- **Liabilities**: What you owe (loans, bills, credit cards, etc.)
- **Equity**: Your net worth (assets minus liabilities)

The balance sheet follows the fundamental accounting equation:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```
