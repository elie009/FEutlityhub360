# 💼 Apportioner Guide

The Apportioner is a smart budget allocation tool that helps you distribute your income across bills, savings, and expenses efficiently.

## 🎯 What is the Apportioner?

The Apportioner helps you:
- Allocate your income across different categories
- Ensure bills are covered first
- Plan for savings goals
- See what's left for discretionary spending
- Balance your budget automatically

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to Apportioner
1. Go to **Apportioner** in the sidebar
2. View your budget allocation interface

### Step 2: Set Your Income
1. Enter your **Monthly Income**
   - This is your take-home pay after taxes
   - Can be your actual income or a target amount
2. The app calculates how to distribute it

### Step 3: View Allocation
The Apportioner shows how your income is distributed:
- **Bills**: Automatic allocation for your recurring bills
- **Savings**: Allocation toward your savings goals
- **Loans**: Loan payment obligations
- **Essential Expenses**: Necessary spending
- **Discretionary**: Remaining funds for flexible spending

## 📊 Understanding the Allocation

### Automatic Allocations

The Apportioner automatically accounts for:
- **All Bills**: Sum of your monthly bills
- **Loan Payments**: Total monthly loan payments
- **Savings Goals**: Target monthly savings contributions
- **Essential Spending**: Estimated necessary expenses

### Remaining Amount

After all obligations:
- **Discretionary Funds**: Money available for flexible spending
- If negative: You're overspending
- If positive: You have flexibility

## ⚙️ Adjusting Allocations

### Manual Adjustments
You can adjust:
1. **Bills Priority**: Which bills to pay first
2. **Savings Amount**: How much to save each month
3. **Essential Spending**: Adjust necessary expense estimates
4. **Loan Payments**: Modify payment amounts (if possible)

### Setting Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Must be covered (bills, loans)
2. **Medium Priority**: Important but flexible (some savings)
3. **Low Priority**: Can be adjusted (discretionary spending)

## 💡 Using the Apportioner Effectively
